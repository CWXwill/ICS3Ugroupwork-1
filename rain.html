		<div class='D'><p><b>Singin' in the Rain is a 1952 American musical romantic comedy film directed and choreographed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, starring Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and Debbie Reynolds and featuring Jean Hagen, Millard Mitchell and Cyd Charisse. It offers a lighthearted depiction of Hollywood in the late 1920s, with the three stars portraying performers caught up in the transition from silent films to "talkies". However, it has since been accorded legendary status by contemporary critics, and is often regarded as the greatest musical film ever made and one of the greatest films ever made. It topped the AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals list and is ranked as the fifth-greatest American motion picture of all time in its updated list of the greatest American films in 2007.</b></p></div>

       <h2>Music</h2>
        <p class='B'>The most important song in this movie has the same name with the film "Singin' in the Rain". The musical film of the same name, Singin' in the Rain (1952), was "suggested by" the song. The performance by Gene Kelly dancing through puddles in a rainstorm garnered the song the third spot on the American Film Institute ranking of 100 Years...100 Songs.Also in the movie the main characters use umbrellas as props and splash around freely in the rain, a performance that has become one of the most iconic tap dance sequences of the show.</p><br>

        <h2>Plot</h2>
    <p class="E">Don Lockwood  is a popular silent film star with humble root. Don barely tolerates his vapid, shallow leading lady, Lina Lamont, who has convinced herself that the fake romance their studio concocted and publicized is real.

To escape from overenthusiastic fans, Don jumps into a passing car driven by Kathy Selden. Later, at a party, the head of Don's studio, R.F. Simpson, shows a short demonstration of a talking picture, but his guests are unimpressed. Don runs into Kathy again at the party. He discovers that Kathy is only a chorus girl. Furious, she throws a pie at him, only to hit Lina right in the face. Later, Don makes up with Kathy and they begin falling in love.

After the first talking picture proves to be a smash hit, R.F. decides convert the new Lockwood and Lamont film, The Dueling Cavalier, into a talkie. The production is beset with difficulties, by far the worst being Lina's comically grating voice.

<p class='E'>Don's best friend, Cosmo Brown, comes up with the idea to overdub Lina's voice with Kathy's.When Lina finds out that Kathy is dubbing her voice, she is furious and does everything possible to sabotage the romance between Don and Kathy.  Then she blackmails R.F. into withholding credit, and, later, demands that Kathy continue to do so in the future.

When the audience clamors for Lina to sing live, Don get Lina to lip-synch while Kathy sings into a second microphone while hidden behind the curtain. Unbeknownst to Lina, as she starts "singing", they open the curtain behind her, revealing the deception Lina flees in embarrassment. When Kathy tries to run away as well, Don has her stopped and introduces the audience to "the real star of the film".

Dan and Kathy start singing a love song. Final cue of they both kissing in front of a huge billboard advertising the film "Singin' in the Rain" with Don Lockwood and Kathy Selden.</p>

    <h2>Silent Movies to Talking Pictures</h2><br>
    <div>
    	<div class="J"><img src='https://n.sinaimg.cn/front/550/w582h768/20190224/1VKW-htknpmi2990424.jpg'width='291px'height='384px'></div>
    	<div class='P'><p>The film is set in the transition from silent to talkies and reflects the filmmakers' attitudes toward talkies. At first the producer's directors felt ridiculous and contemptuous when they heard about talkies, preferring their comfort circle. When the talkies began to blossom, people flocked to them and the producers in the movie quickly changed their attitudes and changed the silent movies to talkies to satisfy the audience's preferences. And since the time of filming is only twenty years away from the birth of the sound film - "The King of Jazz" in 1927, the creators of the film know more about the filming situation at the early stage of the sound film, so the film is closer to the truth and valuable as a study of the history of the sound film.</p></div>
    </div>
     <p class='E'>In the movie Singin' in the Rain, almost every character represents a microcosm of a group of people in the times. Or rather, represents the posture of different filmmakers of the time towards the unknown. What makes this movie such an achievement is its own depth and substance, which is shocking from the inside after watching it.</p>

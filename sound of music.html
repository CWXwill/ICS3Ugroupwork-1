       <h2>Music</h2>
        <p class='B'>The most famous song definitely is "Do-Re-Mi". Maria made up this song in order for seven children to memorize the seven most basic sound names used in singing. She uses harmonization and image memory to make learning to sing more accessible and fun for the children. With its simple melody, lively content, and childlike lyrics, the song has become a musical primer and has been widely circulated around the world.</p><br>

        <p class='B'>The song "The Lonely Goatherd" also is a famous song. The song is well known for its examples of yodeling, a part of the traditional music of the Austrian Alps, where the musical is set. This song tells the whimsical story of a goatherd whose yodelling is heard from far off and by passers-by, until he falls in love with a girl who wears a pale-pink coat, with her mother joining in the yodelling.</p><br>

        <h2>Plot</h2>
    
    <p class="E">Twenty-two-year-old Maria is a nun. However, her active and nature-loving nature has always gotten her into trouble at the convent. The Mother Superior of the convent feels that her active personality is not suitable for the life of a nun. So she decides to send Maria to work as a caretaker for Colonel Von Trapp.
Maria arrives to find him a widower with seven children. He was as strict with his children as he was with his soldiers. The children get no love from their father and always play tricks on the caretaker to get his attention. The colonel demanded that Maria be as strict as he was, but Maria won the children's friendship with her natural gentleness and kindness. While the Colonel was away, she taught them to sing. Gradually the children's old constraints and melancholy were replaced by music and laughter. Soon the Colonel returned home and brought back his girlfriend, the Baroness, whom the children did not like very much. The colonel was very unhappy with Maria's behavior, but when he heard the children singing, he was very touched, because Maria had brought back the music that was no longer in the house!</p><br>

<p class='E'>A few days later, the Colonel and the Baroness had a big ball together. At the ball, the colonel came over to Maria and danced with her, and at the end of the dance they looked at each other, and Maria's heart was pounding for the colonel. The Baroness sees this and that night she urges Maria to return to the convent. Maria was afraid that her feelings for the Colonel would get deeper and deeper, so she quietly left.
Maria confesses her love for the Colonel and her lack of knowledge about life to the Mother Superior, who tells her to have backbone and courage. So Maria returns to Von Trapp's house. Upon Maria's return, the Baroness voluntarily withdraws from the engagement, and the Colonel and Maria tell each other how much they love each other, and soon they are married.
But while Maria and the colonel were on their honeymoon. Soon after, Germany annexed Austria, at this time Max secretly took the children to participate in the festival audition and passed. Upon the patriotic Colonel's urgent return, he not only ignores the rules and rips the Nazi flag from his house, but also rebels against Germany's demands for his entry. The Colonel tries to escape with his family, but is discovered by the secretive butler halfway through and is thus nearly detained, but he has an impromptu change of heart and attends the festival with his children in order to find a chance to escape. In the end, with the help of Max and the nuns, the Colonel's family escapes together over the Alps.</p>

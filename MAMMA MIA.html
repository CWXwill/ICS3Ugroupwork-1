<h2>Music</h2>
        <p class='B'>The most classic song in this movie is "MAMMA MIA". "Mamma Mia" is widely considered to be one of ABBA's best songs. For the song itself, in a great example of lyrical dissonance, this infectiously catchy tune contains very sad lyrics dealing with heartbreak and the pain of letting someone go who you wish you could have back.</p><br>
